# glaciology_practical
 A repo to store and share code from computer practicals in the Columbia University class Glaciology 4220, taught by Jonny Kingslake.

 The first few practicals require python, numpy, matplotlib and jupyterlab. 

 Create the environment using 
 ```
 conda create --name glaciology_class python numpy jupyterlab

```
then activate it using
```
conda activate glaciology_class
```

Then the easiest thing to do is to start jupyterlab with `jupyterlab` then navigate to the notebook corresponding to each practical. 
The notebooks are all in the notebooks directory in this repo.
